Structure web pages with HTML

Process and Design 
* Every website should be designed for the TARGET AUDIENCE. SO It can be helpful to ask some question:

Target audience: Individuals 
- Age range ?  - Will the site appeal to women or men or mix ?  - Avg. income of visitors? - Level of education? 

Target audience: Companies 
 - Size of company ?  - Position of people who visit your site ?  - How large is the budget they control ? 

* Then you want to invent some fictional visitors to influence design decisions.

* Now why do people visit your website ? you need to know motivation and goals . 
 So that your content and design should be influenced by the goal.

* What are your visitors trying to achieve ? 
 you need to list reasons and assign it to the fictional visitors.

* What information your visitors need ? 
 you want to offer additional supporting information by looking at reasons then prioritize level of information to non-essential and background information. 

* How often people will visit your site ?
 like if we need to make update much often for example : news websites.

* Now to start organize information do :
    - Site map to structure the site pages.
    - Wire frames to sketch the key information.  


HTML5 Layout 

HTML5 new elements help define the structure of the page like:
div : to group related elements together. ( div id : to indicate the purpose of this part).

-more new element ( <header> , <footer> , < article> , < aside> , <section> , <hgroup>.

* Older browsers that don't understand html5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level by extra JS.

To collect information from visitors you can use ( Form Control) :

- Adding text ( text input / password input / text area )
- Making choices ( radio button / check boxes / drop down box )
-Submitting ( submit button / img button)
-Uploading files ( file upload )
*Information form is sent in name/value .
