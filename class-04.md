**HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions**

**Links**

Created using the (a) element.which has an attribute called (href) .

* Type of **Links** :
- Links from one website to another:**absoluteURL**

- Links from one page to another on the same website :**relative URL**

- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page:identify the part with id

- Links from one part of a web page to another page:absolute URL or a relative URL, followed by the (#) symbol.

- Links that open in a new browser window:g. The value of attribute(_blank).<a href="http://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">

- Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone:
**Email Links** (mailto:) :eg: <a href="mailto:jon@example.org">Email Jon</a>

**Relative URL**: can be used when linking to pages within your own website.

**Layout**

**Positioning Elements**

* **Building Blocks**: each element in its own box.
- Block-level elements:start on a new line Examples include:(h1) (p) (ul) (li)
- Inline elements:flow in between surrounding text Examples include: (img) (b) (i)

**Containing Elements** :one block-level element (outer box) sits inside another block-level element:group a number of elements together inside (div).

**Positioning schemes** :normal flow(position:static), relative(position:relative), and absolute (position:absolute)

**box offset** :To indicate where a box should be positioned(Fixed (position:fixed) , Floating Elements(Elements Side-by-Side)) width ,float,margin .

**Clearing Float**:to say that no element (withinthe same containing element)
should touch the left or right.

**CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.**

**Grids help create professional and flexible designs.**

**Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).**

**Functions, Methods, and Objects**

**Function**: a serise of statment that grouped together because **they perform specific task**.

**Method** :same as **function** except method created inside an object.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**:

1. Greater efficiency:easier to catch mistakes,come to a solution faster
2. Engaged collaboration:both programmers are more focused
3. Learning from fellow students:Problem solving approach ,developers in a pairing have different skill sets.
4. Social skills:When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is ke
5. Job interview readiness:to carry out exercises together, such as: (code challenges, building a project or feature ordebugging an existing code).
6. Work environment readiness :Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job.
