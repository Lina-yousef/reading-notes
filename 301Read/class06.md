**NODE.JS**

* **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

* **Node.js** is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

* The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.

* **Node.js** Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server.

* It's **a single-threaded**. It’s also **event-driven**, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

* Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

* Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

* Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else.

* It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, 

* **the Advantages of Node.js:**

* You can do everything in the same language, which, as a developer, makes you more productive (and hopefully, happier). For example, you can easily share code between the server and the client.

* **JSON** is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB).

* **JSON** is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program,

meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.
