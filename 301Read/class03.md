**Flexbox and Templating**

**JS Templating**

*Fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source.

**Mustache**

* Logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code.

* It is often referred to as **“logic-less”** because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags.

**Flexbox**

* CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.

* Properties for the Parent **(flex container)**

* Properties for the Children **(flex items)**
* **order property** controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
