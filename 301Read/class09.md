**Refactoring**

* **Functional programming** 

- Is a programming paradigm 

- A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs 

- treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

* The idea of functions as first-class entities is that functions are also treated as values and used as data.

* **Functions as first-class entities can:**

- refer to it from constants and variables
- pass it as a parameter to other functions
- return it as result from other functions

**Higher-order functions**

* a function that either:

- takes one or more functions as arguments.
- returns a function as its result.

**Filter** 

The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection.

**Imperative approach**

* An imperative way to do it with Javascript is to:

- create an empty array evenNumbers
- iterate over the numbers array
- push the even numbers to the evenNumbers array

**Declarative approach**

Using this in the smaller function seems a bit strange in the first place, but is easy to understand.

**Map**

The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

**Reduce**

* The idea of reduce is to receive a function and a collection, and return a value created by combining the items.
