Computer Architecture and Logic

How computers work : what makes a computer, a computer?

They built to solve problems and help us and perform four different tasks : 
1-Take input 
2- Store information 
3- process
4-Output result  

And we have modern computers that we have it like mobile phones , smart watches and this computers also perform the four tasks. now we can use it to talk ,play games and control robots.

-Type of Input : you can tell the computer what to do with (mouse , microphone , camera, touch screens ).
-Storage :all these inputs give a computer information , which then stored in Memory
-Processing : to take the input from memory + Manipulate or change it using (algorithms) in CPU +Send processed information back be stored in memory again
-Output: convert information to physical output like(screen ,play sound,3d printer) .

Binary and Data 

Computer works on (0,1) but it have no big role inside how computer works 
we store and represent information using electricity by one wire we can use a bit 
and with more wires we can use more information and store.
Any number can be represented with (0 ,1).
Other types of information like (text ,image , sounds) 
text :can also represented with numbers.
images: have pixels and each pixel has a color and this color can be presented with numbers.
Sound :series of vibration and vibration can be presented as waveform any waveform can be represent number.

How computers use circuits ?
I can get Creative ideas using circuits
Every input and output are information and to process information I/O a computer needs to modified and combine I so it has millions of electronic component called circuits
Software and hardware
Operating system OS :A master program that manages how software uses hardware of the computer .it can install programs
