The Command Line or Terminal is a text based that you able to type commands and feedback will be given as a text. it has shortcuts to make it easy, for example (echo) is a command to display messages.

Shell is a part to show how terminal will looks after running commands like (shell bash). 

when users want to get to a particular file they simply click on file name on the screen but with command line there's some features to get like : (pwd) tells where we currently , (ls) listing the content , (Absolute and Relative) to get to a particular file and (cd) changes directory.
Under Linux everything is a file. Extension shows what type of file is it ,for example: (index.html) and  Linux is extension less and it is case sensitive that mean we have to type in correct way to get the expected result.
