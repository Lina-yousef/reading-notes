**Positioning Elements**

* Building Blocks: each element in its own box.

* Block-level elements:start on a new line Examples include:(h1) (p) (ul) (li).

* Inline elements:flow in between surrounding text Examples include: (img) (b) (i).

* Containing Elements :one block-level element (outer box) sits inside another.

* block-level element:group a number of elements together inside (div).

* Positioning schemes :normal flow(position:static), relative(position:relative), and absolute (position:absolute).

* box offset :To indicate where a box should be positioned(Fixed (position:fixed), Floating Elements(Elements Side-by-Side)) width ,float,margin .

* Clearing Float:to say that no element (withinthe same containing element) should touch the left or right.

**CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks**

**Grids :** help create professional and flexible designs.

* Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
